Hi, you can call me EJ. I'm a site reliability engineer @ Box currently; you can find waaaay more info about me on my [website](https://www.engjole.net)

tl;dr: into distributed systems, Python, DevOps strategy, & platform engineering.

I also contribute to the [Hunge Labs](https://github.com/hungelabs) project, an nascent open-source specialty coffee knowledgebase. I sometimes contribute to open-source, mainly fixing things I need for personal projects and contributing back upstream.
